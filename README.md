Pset 1 uses knapsack algorithms to figure out how aliens should shuttle their experimental animals across space.

Pset 2 creates a simulation to compare how much time a group of Roomba-like robots will take to clean the floor of a room using two different strategies.

Pset 3 using Python and Pylab, implements a stochastic simulation of patient and virus population dynamics, and reach conclusions about treatment regimens based on the simulation results.
